                        <p>Clinical trials for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are assessing the therapeutic efficacy of systemically delivered adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying a modified DMD transgene. High vector doses (>1E14 vg/kg) are needed to globally transduce skeletal muscles; however, such doses trigger immune-related adverse events. Mitigating these immune responses is crucial for widespread application of AAV-based therapies. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from five participants prior to, and after, dosing. One subject in the high-dose cohort experienced thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Few changes in cell frequencies occurred after treatment; however, differential gene expression demonstrated induction of interferon response genes in most T cell types. T cell clonotype and clumping analysis showed the expansion or appearance of groups of related TCR sequences in the post-treatment samples. Three of these expanded clumps could be assigned to prior human herpesvirus infections, two of which were present in the participant that exhibited TMA. These data provide insight on the mechanistic basis of human immune-AAV interactions and lay a foundation for improved understanding of why TMA arises in some patients and not others.</p>

                        <p>Circulating monocytes participate in pain chronification but the molecular events that cause their deployment are unclear. Using a mouse model of hyperalgesic priming (HP), we show that monocytes enable progression to pain chronicity through a mechanism that requires transient activation of the hydrolase, N-acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA), and the consequent suppression of NAAA-regulated lipid signaling at peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α). Inhibiting NAAA in the 72 hours following administration of a priming stimulus prevented HP. This effect was phenocopied by NAAA deletion and depended on PPAR-α recruitment. Mice lacking NAAA in CD11b+ cells - monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils - were resistant to HP induction. Conversely, mice overexpressing NAAA or lacking PPAR-α in the same cells were constitutively primed. Depletion of monocytes, but not resident macrophages, generated mice that were refractory to HP. The results identify NAAA-regulated signaling in monocytes as a control node in the induction of HP and, potentially, the transition to pain chronicity.</p>

                        <h4>Dysfunction of the aging female mouse urethra is associated with striated muscle loss and increased fibrosis: an initial report</h4>

                        <p>The decline of urethral function with advancing age plays a major role in urinary incontinence in women, impairing quality of life and economically burdening the health care system. However, none of the current urinary incontinence treatments address the declining urethral function with aging, and the mechanisms by which aging impacts urethra physiology remain little known or explored. Here, we have compared functional, morphometric, and global gene expression of urethral tissues between young and old female mice. Bladder leak point pressure (LPP) measurement showed that the aged female mice had 26.55% lower LPP compared to younger mice. Vectorized Scale-Invariant Pattern Recognition (VIPR) analysis of the relative abundance of different tissue components revealed that the mid-urethra of old female mice contains less striated muscle, more extracellular matrix/fibrosis, and diminished elastin fibers ratio compared to young mice. Gene expression profiling analysis (bulk RNA-seq of the whole urethra) showed more down-regulated genes in aged than young mice. Immune response and muscle-related (striated and smooth) pathways were predominantly enriched. In contrast, keratinization, skin development, and cell differentiation pathways were significantly downregulated in aged urethral tissues compared to those from young female mice. These results suggest that molecular pathways (i.e., ACVR1/FST signaling and CTGF/TGF-β signaling) leading to a decreased striated muscle mass and an increase in fibrous extracellular matrix in the process of aging deserve further investigation for their roles in the declined urethral function.</p>

                        <p>Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient parasitic infections and comprise sizable portions of most genomes. Although epigenetic mechanisms silence most ERVs by generating a repressive environment that prevents their expression (heterochromatin), little is known about mechanisms silencing ERVs residing in open regions of the genome (euchromatin). This is particularly important during embryonic development, where induction and repression of distinct classes of ERVs occur in short temporal windows. Here, we demonstrate that transcription-associated RNA degradation by the nuclear RNA exosome and Integrator is a regulatory mechanism that controls the productive transcription of most genes and many ERVs involved in preimplantation development. Disrupting nuclear RNA catabolism promotes dedifferentiation to a totipotent-like state characterized by defects in RNAPII elongation and decreased expression of long genes (gene-length asymmetry). Our results indicate that RNA catabolism is a core regulatory module of gene networks that safeguards RNAPII activity, ERV expression, cell identity, and developmental potency.</p>

                        <p>Breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) is a lethal disease with no effective treatments. Prior work has shown that brain cancers and metastases are densely infiltrated with anti-inflammatory, protumourigenic tumour-associated macrophages, but the role of brain-resident microglia remains controversial because they are challenging to discriminate from other tumour-associated macrophages. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, genetic and humanized mouse models, we specifically identify microglia and find that they play a distinct pro-inflammatory and tumour-suppressive role in BCBM. Animals lacking microglia show increased metastasis, decreased survival and reduced natural killer and T cell responses, showing that microglia are critical to promote anti-tumour immunity to suppress BCBM. We find that the pro-inflammatory response is conserved in human microglia, and markers of their response are associated with better prognosis in patients with BCBM. These findings establish an important role for microglia in anti-tumour immunity and highlight them as a potential immunotherapy target for brain metastasis.</p>

                        <p>High systemic doses of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) have been associated with immune-related serious adverse events (SAEs). Although AAV was well tolerated in preclinical models, SAEs were observed in clinical trials, indicating the need for improved preclinical models to understand AAV-induced immune responses. Here, we show that mice dual-dosed with AAV9 at 4-week intervals better recapitulate aspects of human immunity to AAV. In the model, anti-AAV9 immunoglobulin G (IgGs) increased in a linear fashion between the first and second AAV administrations. Complement activation was only observed in the presence of high levels of both AAV and anti-AAV IgG. Myeloid-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly induced in the same pattern as complement activation, suggesting that myeloid cell activation to AAV may rely on the presence of both AAV and anti-AAV IgG complexes. Single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells confirmed that activated monocytes were a primary source of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which were significantly increased after a second AAV9 exposure. The same activated monocyte clusters expressed both Fcγ and complement receptors, suggesting that anti-AAV-mediated activation of myeloid cells through Fcγ receptors and/or complement receptors is one mechanism by which anti-AAV antigen complexes may prime antigen-presenting cells and amplify downstream immunity.</p>

                        <p>Asynchronous skeletal muscle degeneration/regeneration is a hallmark feature of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD); however, traditional -omics technologies that lack spatial context make it difficult to study the biological mechanisms of how asynchronous regeneration contributes to disease progression. Here, using the severely dystrophic D2-mdx mouse model, we generated a high-resolution cellular and molecular spatial atlas of dystrophic muscle by integrating spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNAseq datasets. Unbiased clustering revealed nonuniform distribution of unique cell populations throughout D2-mdx muscle that were associated with multiple regenerative timepoints, demonstrating that this model faithfully recapitulates the asynchronous regeneration observed in human DMD muscle. By probing spatiotemporal gene expression signatures, we found that propagation of inflammatory and fibrotic signals from locally damaged areas contributes to widespread pathology and that querying expression signatures within discrete microenvironments can identify targetable pathways for DMD therapy. Overall, this spatial atlas of dystrophic muscle provides a valuable resource for studying DMD disease biology and therapeutic target discovery.</p>

                        <p>Macrophages are essential for skeletal muscle homeostasis, but how their dysregulation contributes to the development of fibrosis in muscle disease remains unclear. Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics to determine the molecular attributes of dystrophic and healthy muscle macrophages. We identified six clusters and unexpectedly found that none corresponded to traditional definitions of M1 or M2 macrophages. Rather, the predominant macrophage signature in dystrophic muscle was characterized by high expression of fibrotic factors, galectin-3 (gal-3) and osteopontin (Spp1). Spatial transcriptomics, computational inferences of intercellular communication, and in vitro assays indicated that macrophage-derived Spp1 regulates stromal progenitor differentiation. Gal-3+ macrophages were chronically activated in dystrophic muscle, and adoptive transfer assays showed that the gal-3+ phenotype was the dominant molecular program induced within the dystrophic milieu. Gal-3+ macrophages were also elevated in multiple human myopathies. These studies advance our understanding of macrophages in muscular dystrophy by defining their transcriptional programs and reveal Spp1 as a major regulator of macrophage and stromal progenitor interactions.</p>

                        <p>This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between various outcome measures used to assess disease severity and progression in inclusion body myositis (IBM) clinical trials. A cross-sectional study, involving 51 IBM patients meeting the European Neuromuscular Center (ENMC) 2011 criteria for clinically defined or probable IBM, was completed at the University of California, Irvine. Clinical details, demographic data, and functional data including timed get up (TGU), manual muscle testing, hand grip, pinch dynamometry, as well as IBM functional rating scale (IBMFRS), modified Rankin score, forced vital capacity (FVC), and modified ocular bulbar facial respiratory scale (mOBFRS) were collected on all patients. Descriptive statistics and Pearson's r correlation were performed to analyze the data. Age of the patient did not correlate with any of the outcome measures. Greater severity of IBMFRS scores correlated with longer disease duration as well as greater severity for FVC, strength outcomes, TGU, modified Rankin, and mOBFRS. Additionally, TGU strongly correlated with muscle strength measurements, modified Rankin, and mOBFRS. mOBFRS moderately correlated with IBMFRS, muscle strength, FVC, TGU and modified Rankin score. We demonstrate moderate to strong correlations among the disease severity outcome measures in this study.</p>

                        <p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive, X-linked childhood neuromuscular disorder that results from loss-of-function mutations in the DYSTROPHIN gene. DMD patients exhibit muscle necrosis, cardiomyopathy, respiratory failure, and loss of ambulation. One of the major driving forces of DMD disease pathology is chronic inflammation. The current DMD standard of care is corticosteroids; however, there are serious side effects with long-term use, thus identifying novel anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic treatments for DMD is of high priority. We investigated the next-generation SINE compound, KPT-8602 (eltanexor) as an oral therapeutic to alleviate dystrophic symptoms. We performed pre-clinical evaluation of the effects of KPT-8602 in DMD zebrafish (sapje) and mouse (D2-mdx) models. KPT-8602 improved dystrophic skeletal muscle pathologies, muscle architecture and integrity, and overall outcomes in both animal models. KPT-8602 treatment ameliorated DMD pathology in D2-mdx mice, with increased locomotor behavior and improved muscle histology. KPT-8602 altered the immunological profile of the dystrophic mice, and reduced circulating osteopontin serum levels. These findings demonstrate KPT-8602 as an effective therapeutic in DMD through by promotion of an anti-inflammatory environment and overall improvement of DMD pathological outcomes.</p>

                        <p>Background and objectives: To evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting highly differentiated T cells in patients with inclusion body myositis (IBM) by establishing high-resolution mapping of killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1 (KLRG1+) within the T and natural killer (NK) cell compartments.

                            Methods: Blood was collected from 51 patients with IBM and 19 healthy age-matched donors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were interrogated by flow cytometry using a 12-marker antibody panel. The panel allowed the delineation of naive T cells (Tn), central memory T cells (Tcm), 4 stages of effector memory differentiation T cells (Tem 1-4), and effector memory re-expressing CD45RA T cells (TemRA), as well as total and subpopulations of NK cells based on the differential expression of CD16 and C56.
                            
                            Results: We found that a population of KLRG1+ Tem and TemRA were expanded in both the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subpopulations in patients with IBM. KLRG1 expression in CD8+ T cells increased with T-cell differentiation with the lowest levels of expression in Tn and highest in highly differentiated TemRA and CD56+CD8+ T cells. The frequency of KLRG1+ total NK cells and subpopulations did not differ between patients with IBM and healthy donors. IBM disease duration correlated with increased CD8+ T-cell differentiation.
                            
                            Discussion: Our findings reveal that the selective expansion of blood KLRG1+ T cells in patients with IBM is confined to the TemRA and Tem cellular compartments.</p>

                        <p>Skin epidermis constitutes the exterior barrier that protects the body from dehydration and environmental assaults. Barrier defects underlie common inflammatory skin diseases, but the molecular mechanisms that maintain barrier integrity and regulate epidermal-immune cell cross-talk in inflamed skin are not fully understood. In this study, we show that skin epithelia-specific deletion of Ovol1, which encodes a skin disease‒linked transcriptional repressor, impairs the epidermal barrier and aggravates psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice in part by enhancing neutrophil accumulation and abscess formation. Through molecular studies, we identify IL-33, a cytokine with known pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory activities, and Cxcl1, a neutrophil-attracting chemokine, as potential weak and strong direct targets of Ovol1, respectively. Furthermore, we provide functional evidence that elevated Il33 expression reduces disease severity in imiquimod-treated Ovol1-deficient mice, whereas persistent accumulation and epidermal migration of neutrophils exacerbate it. Collectively, our study uncovers the importance of an epidermally expressed transcription factor that regulates both the integrity of the epidermal barrier and the behavior of neutrophils in psoriasis-like inflammation.</p>

                        <p>Sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) is the most common acquired muscle disease in adults over age 50, yet it remains unclear whether the disease is primarily driven by T cell–mediated autoimmunity. IBM muscle biopsies display nuclear clearance and cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43 in muscle cells, a pathologic finding observed initially in neurodegenerative diseases, where nuclear loss of TDP-43 in neurons causes aberrant RNA splicing. Here, we show that loss of TDP-43–mediated splicing repression, as determined by inclusion of cryptic exons, occurs in skeletal muscle of subjects with IBM. Of 119 muscle biopsies tested, RT-PCR–mediated detection of cryptic exon inclusion was able to diagnose IBM with 84% sensitivity and 99% specificity. To determine the role of T cells in pathogenesis, we generated a xenograft model by transplanting human IBM muscle into the hindlimb of immunodeficient mice. Xenografts from subjects with IBM displayed robust regeneration of human myofibers and recapitulated both inflammatory and degenerative features of the disease. Myofibers in IBM xenografts showed invasion by human, oligoclonal CD8+ T cells and exhibited MHC-I up-regulation, rimmed vacuoles, mitochondrial pathology, p62-positive inclusions, and nuclear clearance and cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43, associated with cryptic exon inclusion. Reduction of human T cells within IBM xenografts by treating mice intraperitoneally with anti-CD3 (OKT3) suppressed MHC-I up-regulation. However, rimmed vacuoles and loss of TDP-43 function persisted. These data suggest that T cell depletion does not alter muscle degenerative pathology in IBM.</p>

                        <p>Foreign body response (FBR) to biomaterials compromises the function of implants and leads to medical complications. Here, we report a hybrid alginate microcapsule (AlgXO) that attenuated the immune response after implantation, through releasing exosomes derived from human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (XOs). Upon release, XOs suppress the local immune microenvironment, where xenotransplantation of rat islets encapsulated in AlgXO led to >170 days euglycemia in immunocompetent mouse model of Type 1 Diabetes. In vitro analyses revealed that XOs suppressed the proliferation of CD3/CD28 activated splenocytes and CD3+ T cells. Comparing suppressive potency of XOs in purified CD3+ T cells versus splenocytes, we found XOs more profoundly suppressed T cells in the splenocytes co-culture, where a heterogenous cell population is present. XOs also suppressed CD3/CD28 activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and reduced their cytokine secretion including IL-2, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-22, and TNFα. We further demonstrate that XOs mechanism of action is likely mediated via myeloid cells and XOs suppress both murine and human macrophages partly by interfering with NFκB pathway. We propose that through controlled release of XOs, AlgXO provide a promising new platform that could alleviate the local immune response to implantable biomaterials.</p>

                        <p>Despite the well-accepted view that chronic inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the function and regulation of eosinophils remain an unclear facet of type II innate immunity in dystrophic muscle. We report the observation that group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are present in skeletal muscle and are the principal regulators of muscle eosinophils during muscular dystrophy. Eosinophils were elevated in DMD patients and dystrophic mice along with interleukin (IL)-5, a major eosinophil survival factor that was predominantly expressed by muscle ILC2s. We also find that IL-33 was upregulated in dystrophic muscle and was predominantly produced by fibrogenic/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). Exogenous IL-33 and IL-2 complex (IL-2c) expanded muscle ILC2s and eosinophils, decreased the cross-sectional area (CSA) of regenerating myofibers, and increased the expression of genes associated with muscle fibrosis. The deletion of ILC2s in dystrophic mice mitigated muscle eosinophilia and impaired the induction of IL-5 and fibrosis-associated genes. Our findings highlight a FAP/ILC2/eosinophil axis that promotes type II innate immunity, which influences the balance between regenerative and fibrotic responses during muscular dystrophy.</p>

                        <p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked muscle wasting disease that is caused by the loss of functional dystrophin protein in cardiac and skeletal muscles. DMD patient muscles become weakened, leading to eventual myofiber breakdown and replacement with fibrotic and adipose tissues. Inflammation drives the pathogenic processes through releasing inflammatory cytokines and other factors that promote skeletal muscle degeneration and contributing to the loss of motor function. Selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINEs) are a class of compounds that function by inhibiting the nuclear export protein exportin 1 (XPO1). The XPO1 protein is an important regulator of key inflammatory and neurological factors that drive inflammation and neurotoxicity in various neurological and neuromuscular diseases. Here, we demonstrate that SINE compound KPT-350 can ameliorate dystrophic-associated pathologies in the muscles of DMD models of zebrafish and mice. Thus, SINE compounds are a promising novel strategy for blocking dystrophic symptoms and could be used in combinatorial treatments for DMD.</p>

                        <p>Skeletal muscle injury provokes a regenerative response, characterized by the de novo generation of myofibers that are distinguished by central nucleation and re-expression of developmentally restricted genes. In addition to these characteristics, myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA) is widely used to evaluate muscle hypertrophic and regenerative responses. Here, we introduce QuantiMus, a free software program that uses machine learning algorithms to quantify muscle morphology and molecular features with high precision and quick processing-time. The ability of QuantiMus to define and measure myofibers was compared to manual measurement or other automated software programs. QuantiMus rapidly and accurately defined total myofibers and measured CSA with comparable performance but quantified the CSA of centrally-nucleated fibers (CNFs) with greater precision compared to other software. It additionally quantified the fluorescence intensity of individual myofibers of human and mouse muscle, which was used to assess the distribution of myofiber type, based on the myosin heavy chain isoform that was expressed. Furthermore, analysis of entire quadriceps cross-sections of healthy and mdx mice showed that dystrophic muscle had an increased frequency of Evans blue dye+ injured myofibers. QuantiMus also revealed that the proportion of centrally nucleated, regenerating myofibers that express embryonic myosin heavy chain (eMyHC) or neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) were increased in dystrophic mice. Our findings reveal that QuantiMus has several advantages over existing software. The unique self-learning capacity of the machine learning algorithms provides superior accuracy and the ability to rapidly interrogate the complete muscle section. These qualities increase rigor and reproducibility by avoiding methods that rely on the sampling of representative areas of a section. This is of particular importance for the analysis of dystrophic muscle given the "patchy" distribution of muscle pathology. QuantiMus is an open source tool, allowing customization to meet investigator-specific needs and provides novel analytical approaches for quantifying muscle morphology.</p>

                        <p>Although mutations of the dystrophin gene are the causative defect in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients, secondary disease processes such as inflammation contribute greatly to the pathogenesis of DMD. Genetic and histological studies have shown that distinct facets of the immune system promote muscle degeneration or regeneration during muscular dystrophy through mechanisms that are only beginning to be defined. Although histological methods have allowed the enumeration and localization of immune cells within dystrophic muscle, they are limited in their ability to assess the full spectrum of phenotypic states of an immune cell population and its functional characteristics. This chapter highlights flow cytometry methods for the isolation and functional study of immune cell populations from muscle of the mdx mouse model of DMD. We include a detailed description of preparing single-cell suspensions of dystrophic muscle that maintain the integrity of cell-surface markers used to identify macrophages, eosinophils, group 2 innate lymphoid cells, and regulatory T cells. This method complements the battery of histological assays that are currently used to study the role of inflammation in muscular dystrophy, and provides a platform capable of being integrated with multiple downstream methodologies for the mechanistic study of immunity in muscle degenerative diseases.</p>

                        <p>We describe a novel B cell-associated cytokine, encoded by an uncharacterized gene (C17orf99; chromosome 17 open reading frame 99), that is expressed in bone marrow and fetal liver and whose expression is also induced in peripheral B cells upon activation. C17orf99 is only present in mammalian genomes, and it encodes a small (∼27-kDa) secreted protein unrelated to other cytokine families, suggesting a function in mammalian immune responses. Accordingly, C17orf99 expression is induced in the mammary gland upon the onset of lactation, and a C17orf99-/- mouse exhibits reduced levels of IgA in the serum, gut, feces, and lactating mammary gland. C17orf99-/- mice have smaller and fewer Peyer's patches and lower numbers of IgA-secreting cells. The microbiome of C17orf99-/- mice exhibits altered composition, likely a consequence of the reduced levels of IgA in the gut. Although naive B cells can express C17orf99 upon activation, their production increases following culture with various cytokines, including IL-4 and TGF-β1, suggesting that differentiation can result in the expansion of C17orf99-producing B cells during some immune responses. Taken together, these observations indicate that C17orf99 encodes a novel B cell-associated cytokine, which we have called IL-40, that plays an important role in humoral immune responses and may also play a role in B cell development. Importantly, IL-40 is also expressed by human activated B cells and by several human B cell lymphomas. The latter observations suggest that it may play a role in the pathogenesis of certain human diseases.</p>

                        <p>In cells experiencing unrelieved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the ER transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease (RNase)—IRE1α—endonucleolytically degrades ER-localized mRNAs to promote apoptosis. Here we find that the ABL family of tyrosine kinases rheostatically enhances IRE1α’s enzymatic activities, thereby potentiating ER stress-induced apoptosis. During ER stress, cytosolic ABL kinases localize to the ER membrane, where they bind, scaffold, and hyperactivate IRE1α’s RNase. Imatinib—an anti-cancer tyrosine kinase inhibitor—antagonizes the ABL-IRE1α interaction, blunts IRE1α RNase hyperactivity, reduces pancreatic β cell apoptosis, and reverses type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model. A mono-selective kinase inhibitor that allosterically attenuates IRE1α’s RNase—KIRA8—also efficaciously reverses established diabetes in NOD mice by sparing β cells and preserving their physiological function. Our data support a model wherein ER-stressed β cells contribute to their own demise during T1D pathogenesis and implicate the ABL-IRE1α axis as a drug target for the treatment of an autoimmune disease.</p>

                        <h4>FOXO1 Mediates Vitamin D Deficiency-Induced Insulin Resistance in Skeletal Muscle</h4>
                        <p class="authors">Chen, S., Villalta, S. A., & Agrawal, D. K.</p>

                        <p>Prospective epidemiological studies have consistently shown a relationship between vitamin D deficiency, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). This is supported by recent trials showing that vitamin D supplementation in prediabetic or insulin-resistant patients with inadequate vitamin D levels improves insulin sensitivity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying vitamin D deficiency-induced insulin resistance and DM2 remain unknown. Skeletal muscle insulin resistance is a primary defect in the majority of patients with DM2. Although sustained activation of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) in skeletal muscle causes insulin resistance, a relationship between vitamin D deficiency and FOXO1 activation in muscle is unknown. We generated skeletal muscle-specific vitamin D receptor (VDR)-null mice and discovered that these mice developed insulin resistance and glucose intolerance accompanied by increased expression and activity of FOXO1. We also found sustained FOXO1 activation in the skeletal muscle of global VDR-null mice. Treatment of C2C12 muscle cells with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (VD3) reduced FOXO1 expression, nuclear translocation, and activity. The VD3-dependent suppression of FOXO1 activation disappeared by knockdown of VDR, indicating that it is VDR-dependent. Taken together, these results suggest that FOXO1 is a critical target mediating VDR-null signaling in skeletal muscle. The novel findings provide the conceptual support that persistent FOXO1 activation may be responsible for insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism in vitamin D signaling-deficient mice, as well as evidence for the utility of vitamin D supplementation for intervention in DM2.</p>

                        <p>Immunological and inflammatory processes downstream of dystrophin deficiency as well as metabolic abnormalities, defective autophagy, and loss of regenerative capacity all contribute to muscle pathology in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). These downstream cascades offer potential avenues for pharmacological intervention. Modulating the inflammatory response and inducing immunological tolerance to de novo dystrophin expression will be critical to the success of dystrophin-replacement therapies. This Review focuses on the role of the inflammatory response in DMD pathogenesis and opportunities for clinical intervention.</p>

                        <p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the X-linked dystrophin gene, resulting in reduced or absent protein production, subsequently leading to the structural instability of the dystroglycan complex (DGC), muscle degeneration, and early death in males. Thus, current treatments have been targeting the genetic defect either by bypassing the mutation through exon skipping or replacing the defective gene through gene therapy and stem cell approaches. However, what has been an underappreciated mediator of muscle pathology and, ultimately, of muscle degeneration and fibrotic replacement, is the prominent inflammatory response. Of potentially critical importance, however, is the fact that the elements mediating the inflammatory response also play an essential role in tissue repair. In this opinion piece, we highlight the detrimental and supportive immune parameters that occur as a consequence of the genetic disorder and discuss how changes to immunity can potentially ameliorate the disease intensity and be employed in conjunction with efforts to correct the genetic disorder.</p>

                        <p>We examined the hypothesis that regulatory T cells (Tregs) modulate muscle injury and inflammation in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Although Tregs were largely absent in the muscle of wild-type mice and normal human muscle, they were present in necrotic lesions, displayed an activated phenotype, and showed increased expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in dystrophic muscle from mdx mice. Depletion of Tregs exacerbated muscle injury and the severity of muscle inflammation, which was characterized by an enhanced interferon-γ (IFN-γ) response and activation of M1 macrophages. To test the therapeutic value of targeting Tregs in muscular dystrophy, we treated mdx mice with IL-2/anti-IL-2 complexes and found that Tregs and IL-10 concentrations were increased in muscle, resulting in reduced expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and decreased myofiber injury. These findings suggest that Tregs modulate the progression of muscular dystrophy by suppressing type 1 inflammation in muscle associated with muscle fiber injury, and highlight the potential of Treg-modulating agents as therapeutics for DMD.</p>

                        <p>The dysregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in multiple cell types during chronic inflammation is indicative of their pathogenic role in autoimmune diseases. Among the many RTKs, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) stands out for its multiple effects on immunity, vascularization, and cell migration. Herein, we examined whether VEGFR participated in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. We found that RTK inhibitors (RTKIs) and VEGF or VEGFR-2 antibodies reversed diabetes when administered at the onset of hyperglycemia. Increased VEGF expression promoted islet vascular remodeling in NOD mice, and inhibition of VEGFR activity with RTKIs abrogated the increase in islet vascularity, impairing T-cell migration into the islet and improving glucose control. Metabolic studies confirmed that RTKIs worked by preserving islet function, as treated mice had improved glucose tolerance without affecting insulin sensitivity. Finally, examination of human pancreata from patients with T1D revealed that VEGFR-2 was confined to the islet vascularity, which was increased in inflamed islets. Collectively, this work reveals a previously unappreciated role for VEGFR-2 signaling in the pathogenesis of T1D by controlling T-cell accessibility to the pancreatic islets and highlights a novel application of VEGFR-2 antagonists for the therapeutic treatment of T1D.</p>

                        <p>We examined the function of IL-10 in regulating changes in macrophage phenotype during muscle growth and regeneration following injury. Our findings showed that the Th1 cytokine response in inflamed muscle is characterized by high levels of expression of CD68, CCL-2, TNF-α, and IL-6 at 1 d postinjury. During transition to the Th2 cytokine response, expression of those transcripts declined, whereas CD163, IL-10, IL-10R1, and arginase-1 increased. Ablation of IL-10 amplified the Th1 response at 1 d postinjury, causing increases in IL-6 and CCL2, while preventing a subsequent increase in CD163 and arginase-1. Reductions in muscle fiber damage that normally occurred between 1 and 4 d postinjury did not occur in IL-10 mutants. In addition, muscle regeneration and growth were greatly slowed by loss of IL-10. Furthermore, myogenin expression increased in IL-10 mutant muscle at 1 d postinjury, suggesting that the mutation amplified the transition from the proliferative to the early differentiation stages of myogenesis. In vitro assays showed that stimulation of muscle cells with IL-10 had no effect on cell proliferation or expression of MyoD or myogenin. However, coculturing muscle cells with macrophages activated with IL-10 to the M2 phenotype increased myoblast proliferation without affecting MyoD or myogenin expression, showing that M2 macrophages promote the early, proliferative stage of myogenesis. Collectively, these data show that IL-10 plays a central role in regulating the switch of muscle macrophages from a M1 to M2 phenotype in injured muscle in vivo, and this transition is necessary for normal growth and regeneration of muscle.</p>

                        <p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a degenerative disorder that leads to death by the third decade of life. Previous investigations have shown that macrophages that invade dystrophic muscle are a heterogeneous population consisting of M1 and M2 macrophages that promote injury and repair, respectively. In the present investigation, we tested whether IFN-γ worsens the severity of mdx dystrophy by activating macrophages to a cytolytic M1 phenotype and by suppressing the activation of proregenerative macrophages to an M2 phenotype. IFN-γ is a strong inducer of the M1 phenotype and is elevated in mdx dystrophy. Contrary to our expectations, null mutation of IFN-γ caused no reduction of cytotoxicity of macrophages isolated from mdx muscle and did not reduce muscle fiber damage in vivo or improve gross motor function of mdx mice at the early, acute peak of pathology. In contrast, ablation of IFN-γ reduced muscle damage in vivo during the regenerative stage of the disease and increased activation of the M2 phenotype and improved motor function of mdx mice at that later stage of the disease. IFN-γ also inhibited muscle cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro, and IFN-γ mutation increased MyoD expression in mdx muscle in vivo, showing that IFN-γ can have direct effects on muscle cells that could impair repair. Taken together, the findings show that suppression of IFN-γ signaling in muscular dystrophy reduces muscle damage and improves motor performance by promoting the M2 macrophage phenotype and by direct actions on muscle cells.</p>

                        <p>M1 macrophages play a major role in worsening muscle injury in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, mdx muscle also contains M2c macrophages that can promote tissue repair, indicating that factors regulating the balance between M1 and M2c phenotypes could influence the severity of the disease. Because interleukin-10 (IL-10) modulates macrophage activation in vitro and its expression is elevated in mdx muscles, we tested whether IL-10 influenced the macrophage phenotype in mdx muscle and whether changes in IL-10 expression affected the pathology of muscular dystrophy. Ablation of IL-10 expression in mdx mice increased muscle damage in vivo and reduced mouse strength. Treating mdx muscle macrophages with IL-10 reduced activation of the M1 phenotype, assessed by iNOS expression, and macrophages from IL-10 null mutant mice were more cytolytic than macrophages isolated from wild-type mice. Our data also showed that muscle cells in mdx muscle expressed the IL-10 receptor, suggesting that IL-10 could have direct effects on muscle cells. We assayed whether ablation of IL-10 in mdx mice affected satellite cell numbers, using Pax7 expression as an index, but found no effect. However, IL-10 mutation significantly increased myogenin expression in vivo during the acute and the regenerative phase of mdx pathology. Together, the results show that IL-10 plays a significant regulatory role in muscular dystrophy that may be caused by reducing M1 macrophage activation and cytotoxicity, increasing M2c macrophage activation and modulating muscle differentiation.</p>

                        <p>Recent discoveries reveal complex interactions between skeletal muscle and the immune system that regulate muscle regeneration. In this review, we evaluate evidence that indicates that the response of myeloid cells to muscle injury promotes muscle regeneration and growth. Acute perturbations of muscle activate a sequence of interactions between muscle and inflammatory cells. The initial inflammatory response is a characteristic Th1 inflammatory response, first dominated by neutrophils and subsequently by CD68(+) M1 macrophages. M1 macrophages can propagate the Th1 response by releasing proinflammatory cytokines and cause further tissue damage through the release of nitric oxide. Myeloid cells in the early Th1 response stimulate the proliferative phase of myogenesis through mechanisms mediated by TNF-alpha and IL-6; experimental prolongation of their presence is associated with delayed transition to the early differentiation stage of myogenesis. Subsequent invasion by CD163(+)/CD206(+) M2 macrophages attenuates M1 populations through the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10. M2 macrophages play a major role in promoting growth and regeneration; their absence greatly slows muscle growth following injury or modified use and inhibits muscle differentiation and regeneration. Chronic muscle injury leads to profiles of macrophage invasion and function that differ from acute injuries. For example, mdx muscular dystrophy yields invasion of muscle by M1 macrophages, but their early invasion is accompanied by a subpopulation of M2a macrophages. M2a macrophages are IL-4 receptor(+)/CD206(+) cells that reduce cytotoxicity of M1 macrophages. Subsequent invasion of dystrophic muscle by M2c macrophages is associated with progression of the regenerative phase in pathophysiology. Together, these findings show that transitions in macrophage phenotype are an essential component of muscle regeneration in vivo following acute or chronic muscle damage.</p>

                        <h4>Shifts in macrophage phenotypes and macrophage competition for arginine metabolism affect the severity of muscle pathology in muscular dystrophy</h4>

                        <p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common, lethal, muscle-wasting disease of childhood. Previous investigations have shown that muscle macrophages may play an important role in promoting the pathology in the mdx mouse model of DMD. In the present study, we investigate the mechanism through which macrophages promote mdx dystrophy and assess whether the phenotype of the macrophages changes between the stage of peak muscle necrosis (4 weeks of age) and muscle regeneration (12 weeks). We find that 4-week-old mdx muscles contain a population of pro-inflammatory, classically activated M1 macrophages that lyse muscle in vitro by NO-mediated mechanisms. Genetic ablation of the iNOS gene in mdx mice also significantly reduces muscle membrane lysis in 4-week-old mdx mice in vivo. However, 4-week mdx muscles also contain a population of alternatively activated, M2a macrophages that express arginase. In vitro assays show that M2a macrophages reduce lysis of muscle cells by M1 macrophages through the competition of arginase in M2a cells with iNOS in M1 cells for their common, enzymatic substrate, arginine. During the transition from the acute peak of mdx pathology to the regenerative stage, expression of IL-4 and IL-10 increases, either of which can deactivate the M1 phenotype and promote activation of a CD163+, M2c phenotype that can increase tissue repair. Our findings further show that IL-10 stimulation of macrophages activates their ability to promote satellite cell proliferation. Deactivation of the M1 phenotype is also associated with a reduced expression of iNOS, IL-6, MCP-1 and IP-10. Thus, these results show that distinct subpopulations of macrophages can promote muscle injury or repair in muscular dystrophy, and that therapeutic interventions that affect the balance between M1 and M2 macrophage populations may influence the course of muscular dystrophy.</p>

                        <p>The pleiotropic cytokine IL-6 has favorable and harmful effects on survival from bacterial infections. Although many innate immune cells produce IL-6, little is known about relevant sources in vivo and the nature of its contributions to host responses to severe bacterial infections. To examine these roles, we subjected mast cell-specific IL-6-deficient mice to the cecal ligation and puncture model of septic peritonitis, finding that survival in these mice is markedly worse than in controls. Following intranasal or i.p. inoculation with Klebsiella pneumoniae, IL-6 (-/-) mice are less likely to survive than wild-type controls and at the time of death have higher numbers of bacteria but not inflammatory cells in lungs and peritoneum. Similarly, mast cell-specific IL-6-deficient mice have diminished survival and higher numbers of K. pneumoniae following i.p. infection. Neutrophils lacking IL-6 have greater numbers of live intracellular K. pneumonia, suggesting impaired intracellular killing contributes to reduced clearance in IL-6(-/-) mice. These results establish that mast cell IL-6 is a critical mediator of survival following K. pneumoniae infection and sepsis and suggest that IL-6 protects from death by augmenting neutrophil killing of bacteria.</p>

                        <p>The immune response to dystrophin-deficient muscle promotes the pathology of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and the mdx mouse model of DMD. In this investigation, we find that the release of major basic protein (MBP) by eosinophils is a prominent feature of DMD and mdx dystrophy and that eosinophils lyse muscle cells in vitro by the release of MBP-1. We also show that eosinophil depletions of mdx mice by injections of anti-chemokine receptor-3 reduce muscle cell lysis, although lysis of mdx muscle membranes is not reduced by null mutation of MBP-1 in vivo. However, ablation of MBP-1 expression in mdx mice produces other effects on muscular dystrophy. First, fibrosis of muscle and hearts, a major cause of mortality in DMD, is greatly reduced by null mutation of MBP-1 in mdx mice. Furthermore, either ablation of MBP-1 or eosinophil depletion causes large increases in cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) in mdx muscles. The increase in CTLs in MBP-1-null mice does not reflect a general shift toward a Th1 inflammatory response, because the mutation had no significant effect on the expression of interferon-gamma, inducible nitric oxide synthase or tumor necrosis factor. Rather, MBP-1 reduces the activation and proliferation of splenocytes in vitro, indicating that MBP-1 acts in a more specific immunomodulatory role to affect the inflammatory response in muscular dystrophy. Together, these findings show that eosinophil-derived MBP-1 plays a significant role in regulating muscular dystrophy by attenuating the cellular immune response and promoting tissue fibrosis that can eventually contribute to increased mortality.</p>

                        <p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal X-linked disorder associated with dystrophin deficiency that results in chronic inflammation and severe skeletal muscle degeneration. In DMD mouse models and patients, we find that IkappaB kinase/NF-kappaB (IKK/NF-kappaB) signaling is persistently elevated in immune cells and regenerative muscle fibers. Ablation of 1 allele of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB was sufficient to improve pathology in mdx mice, a model of DMD. In addition, conditional deletion of IKKbeta in mdx mice elucidated that NF-kappaB functions in activated macrophages to promote inflammation and muscle necrosis and in skeletal muscle fibers to limit regeneration through the inhibition of muscle progenitor cells. Furthermore, specific pharmacological inhibition of IKK resulted in improved pathology and muscle function in mdx mice. Collectively, these results underscore the critical role of NF-kappaB in the progression of muscular dystrophy and suggest the IKK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target for DMD.</p>

                        <p>Background: Mast cell-deficient Kit(W)/Kit(W-v) mice are an important resource for studying mast cell functions in vivo. However, because they are compound heterozygotes in a mixed genetic background and are infertile, they cannot be crossed easily with other mice.
                            Objective: To overcome this limitation, we explored the use of Kit(W-sh)/Kit(W-sh) mice for studying mast cell biology in vivo.
                            Results: These mice are in a C57BL/6 background, are fertile and can be bred directly with other genetically modified mice. Ten-week-old Kit(W-sh)/Kit(W-sh) are profoundly mast cell-deficient. No mast cells are detected in any major organ, including the lung. Gene microarrays detect differential expression of just seven of 16,463 genes in lungs of Kit(W-sh)/Kit(W-sh) mice compared with wild-type mice, indicating that resting mast cells regulate expression of a small set of genes in the normal lung. Injecting 10(7) bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) into tail veins of Kit(W-sh)/Kit(W-sh) mice reconstitutes mast cell populations in lung, stomach, liver, inguinal lymph nodes, and spleen, but not in the tongue, trachea or skin. Injection of BMMC into ear dermis or peritoneum reconstitutes mast cells locally in these tissues. When splenectomized Kit(W-sh)/Kit(W-sh) mice are intravenously injected with BMMC, mast cells circulate longer and are found more often in the liver and inguinal lymph nodes, indicating that the spleen acts as a reservoir for mast cells following injection and limits migration to some tissues.
                            Conclusion: In summary, these findings show that mast cell-deficient Kit(W-sh)/Kit(W-sh) mice possess unique attributes that favour their use for studying mast cell functions in vivo.</p>

                        <p>Sepsis is a common, life-threatening disease for which there is little treatment. The cysteine protease dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPPI) activates granule-associated serine proteases, several of which play important roles in host responses to bacterial infection. To examine DPPI's role in sepsis, we compared DPPI(-/-) and DPPI(+/+) mice using the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of septic peritonitis, finding that DPPI(-/-) mice are far more likely to survive sepsis. Outcomes of CLP in mice lacking mast cell DPPI reveal that the absence of DPPI in mast cells, rather than in other cell types, is responsible for the survival advantage. Among several cytokines surveyed in peritoneal fluid and serum, IL-6 is highly and differentially expressed in DPPI(-/-) mice compared with DPPI(+/+) mice. Remarkably, deleting IL-6 expression in DPPI(-/-) mice eliminates the survival advantage. The increase in IL-6 in septic DPPI(-/-) mice, which appears to protect these mice from death, may be related to reduced DPPI-mediated activation of mast cell tryptase and other peptidases, which we show cleave IL-6 in vitro. These results indicate that mast cell DPPI harms the septic host and that DPPI is a novel potential therapeutic target for treatment of sepsis.</p>
