                        <h3>Ligand-assisted delivery of tolerogenic therapies to muscle</h3>
                        <p>We are developing novel approaches to deliver tolerogenic therapies to muscle. Currently, we are using novel conjugation chemistries developed by our collaborator at Purdue to link muscle-specific antibodies to a single-chain IL-2 complex engineered by our colleagues at John Hopkins. This approach is expected to deliver IL-2 complex to the muscle and induce Tregs to promote tolerance and suppress muscle inflammation while mitigating off-target effects and global immunosuppression.</p>

                        <h3>Engineering muscle-specific chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) for regulatory T cells</h3>
                        <p>Synthetic biology has revolutionized multiple sectors of the scientific enterprise. In medicine, the most relevant synthetic biology-inspired therapeutic is the CAR-T cell. More recently this approach has been applied to Tregs with the key goal of generating CAR-Tregs to promote tolerance in autoimmunity. Our lab is developing muscle-specific CARs that targets cell surface muscle proteins as a novel approach to suppress muscle inflammation and induce tolerance to exogenously-introduced therapeutic transgenes.</p>
