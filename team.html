                            <p class="team-member-position">Lab Director</p>
                            <p class="team-member-studies"><strong>Education:</strong> Ph.D. in Physiology, UCLA</p>
                            <p class="team-member-bio">The overall goal of the research in the Villalta laboratory is directed towards understanding how immune cells contribute to tissue injury and repair in degenerative and autoimmune diseases. During these pathological conditions immune cells contribute to disease pathogenesis by promoting altered cellular states of chronic stress and inflicting injury on the target tissue through cytolytic mechanisms. Specialized subsets of immune regulatory cells also exist that are critical in orchestrating the resolution of inflammation and tissue repair through the suppression of effector immune cells and direct interactions with the tissue that promote regeneration. Although several studies have characterized immune cell subpopulations in muscle that possess either pro-injury or pro-reparative functions, little is known about the signals regulating these distinct functional programs. To address this lack in understanding our laboratory uses the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which has provided the field an excellent system to investigate the role of immunity in muscular dystrophy and how immune cells contribute to muscle injury and repair.</p>
